This is a reposetory with small console games

Short description:

  1. <b>"Guess the number"</b> - In the game "Guess the Number", the player tries to guess a number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the player is told whether the actual number is higher or lower than their guess, until they correctly guess the number. The goal is to guess the number in as few attempts as possible. It is a simple yet fun game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.

  2. <b>"Multiplication table"</b> is a console game for practicing multiplication table. The game generates two random numbers between 1 and 10 and asks the player to input their product. If the player inputs the correct answer, their score increases by 1, and the game generates a new pair of numbers. If the player inputs the incorrect answer or any non-digit character, their score resets to 0. The game can be exited at any time by inputting "q". The player's best score is recorded and displayed at the end of the game.
  
  3. <b>"Lottery"</b> - This is a Java-based lottery game inspired by Bulgaria's popular "Toto 2" lottery. The game generates six random numbers between 1 and 49, and prompts the user to enter six numbers of their choice. If the user enters a number that is already in their list, they are prompted to try again. Once the user has entered their numbers, the program displays the lottery numbers and the user's numbers, and checks how many numbers the user has guessed correctly. If the user has guessed any numbers correctly, the program displays the number of correct guesses and the numbers that were guessed correctly. The user can then choose to play again or exit the game. The program keeps track of the user's games and their statistics, such as how many games were played and how many correct guesses they had.
