Short description:

  1. <b>"Guess the number"</b> - In the game "Guess the Number", the player tries to guess a number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the player is told whether the actual number is higher or lower than their guess, until they correctly guess the number. The goal is to guess the number in as few attempts as possible. It is a simple yet fun game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.

  2. <b>"Multiplication table"</b> is a console game for practicing multiplication table. The game generates two random numbers between 1 and 10 and asks the player to input their product. If the player inputs the correct answer, their score increases by 1, and the game generates a new pair of numbers. If the player inputs the incorrect answer or any non-digit character, their score resets to 0. The game can be exited at any time by inputting "q". The player's best score is recorded and displayed at the end of the game.
